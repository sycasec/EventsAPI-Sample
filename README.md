# EventsAPI-Sample
Sample Events Tracker API (flask RESTful, python obviously, flask SQL-alchemy)

## This is a Sample RESTful API with working endpoints
The database is local, and is not really hosted on any platform, but you could get it up and running with a python interpreter and with the following packages:

* Flask `pip install flask`
* Flask restful `pip install flask-restful`
* Flask SQLAlchemy `pip install flask-sqlalchemy`
